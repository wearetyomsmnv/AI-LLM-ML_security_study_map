# AI/LLM/ML Security Map

Welcome to the "AI/LLM/ML Security Map" project - your guide through the complex landscape of AI security. Here you will find a .pdf map, a compendium of knowledge essential for professionals in the field of AI security.

## Foreword on AI Security üõ°Ô∏è

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the importance of securing AI systems cannot be overstated. From safeguarding personal data to preventing malicious exploits, the field of AI security is rapidly evolving to address these critical challenges. Our project aims to map out the pathway for specialists seeking to navigate and contribute to the crucial domain of AI security.

## About the Map üó∫Ô∏è

This repository is much more than a mere collection of links. It serves as a reservoir of practical knowledge, centering around classical disciplines from the world of traditional security, including:

- **AppSec** (Application Security)
- **OffSec Expert** (Offensive Security)
- **Blue Team** (Defensive Security)
- **Law and standarts** 

üõ†Ô∏è We have implemented a level system to evaluate and structure knowledge by complexity and relevancy. Despite some challenges in assessing each level, this system provides a clear visual of the skills and tools applicable at different stages of a specialist's development.

üíº Every role featured on the map is accompanied by not only terms and concepts but also existing tools that are ready for implementation. Valuable resources such as **awesome_mlsecops** and **Offsec ML Playbook** have been instrumental in curating the most current and effective content.

üî¢ A dedicated segment on mathematics outlines its importance as a foundational component for every AI security professional.

## News and Research üìö

The map also points to resources where you can keep up-to-date with the latest news or delve into fresh research in AI security. It provides an opportunity for anyone who wishes to become a researcher and contribute to the advancement of the field.

Join the community of professionals and conquer the summits of knowledge with our AI security map!
